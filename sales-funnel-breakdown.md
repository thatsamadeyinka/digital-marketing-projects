# Sales Funnel Strategy (UK Relocation Example)

Breaking down the complete funnel I built for Firespring.org's UK relocation consulting service.

## Funnel Overview

**Goal:** Generate qualified leads for UK visa and relocation consulting
**Target:** Professionals looking to relocate to the UK
**Conversion:** Landing page > Multi step form > Consultation booking

---

## Stage 1: Traffic (Top of Funnel)

**Traffic Sources:**
- Facebook Ads (targeting Nigerian professionals interested in UK migration)
- Google Ads (keywords: "UK visa consultant", "relocate to UK from Nigeria")
- LinkedIn organic content
- Referral partners (recruitment agencies)

**Ad Copy Focus:**
Pain point: "Tired of confusing UK visa requirements?"
Promise: "We handle everything from visa to job placement"
CTA: "Get your free consultation"

---

## Stage 2: Landing Page (Middle of Funnel)

**URL:** https://firespring.org/uk-relocation-system

**Key Elements:**
- Hero section with clear value prop
- Trust indicators (success stories, certifications)
- Benefits over features ("Land your UK job in 90 days")
- Multi step form (reduces friction, increases completion)
- Exit intent popup (captures abandoning visitors)

**Copy Strategy:**
Address objections head on:
"Is the process complicated?" > "We simplify it in 3 steps"
"How long does it take?" > "90 days from start to UK arrival"
"Can I trust this?" > "200+ successful relocations" (with testimonials)

## Stage 3: Multi Step Form (Conversion Point)

**Why multi step works better than single page:**
- Feels less overwhelming
- Higher completion rate
- Collects qualified info progressively

**Form Fields (4 Steps):**

Step 1: What's your goal?
- Work in UK
- Study in UK  
- Permanent relocation

Step 2: Your background
- Current profession
- Years of experience
- Degree level

Step 3: Timeline
- Ready to move in 3 months
- 6 months
- 12+ months

Step 4: Contact info
- Name
- Email
- Phone
- Preferred consultation time

## Stage 4: Thank You Page (Post Conversion)

**Immediate Actions:**
- Confirmation message
- Calendar link to book consultation
- Welcome email triggered automatically
- Add to CRM (tagged as "UK relocation lead")

**Thank You Page Copy:**

"Thanks [Name]. Your consultation request is confirmed.

What happens next:

1. Check your email (we just sent you a confirmation)
2. Book your consultation time: [Calendar Link]
3. Prepare your questions (we'll cover everything)

See you on the call.

## Stage 5: Nurture Sequence (Email Follow Up)

**Email 1 (Immediate):** Confirmation + calendar link
**Email 2 (Next day):** Success story + remind to book call
**Email 3 (Day 3):** FAQ video + final reminder
**Email 4 (Day 5):** Case study + soft pitch for paid service

## Conversion Optimization Tactics Used

**1. Removed navigation menu**
One goal per page. No distractions.

**2. Added live chat**
Answer questions in real time, reduce bounce rate.

**3. Social proof placement**
Testimonials right before the form. Builds trust at decision point.

**4. Mobile optimization**
70% of traffic was mobile. Form fields adjusted for mobile UX.

**5. Retargeting pixel**
Track visitors who didn't convert. Retarget with ads showing testimonials.

---

## Results

**Before optimization:**
- Conversion rate: 1.8%
- Cost per lead: $45
- Form abandonment: 68%

**After implementation:**
- Conversion rate: 5.2%
- Cost per lead: $18
- Form abandonment: 42%

**Formula:** Better copy + multi step form + trust building + retargeting = 3x more leads at lower cost.

This funnel can be adapted for any high ticket service. The structure stays the same.
