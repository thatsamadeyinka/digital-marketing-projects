# Conversion Optimization Checklist

What I check before launching any landing page or funnel.

## Technical Setup

- [ ] Page loads in under 3 seconds
- [ ] Mobile responsive (test on actual devices)
- [ ] All links work (no 404 errors)
- [ ] Forms submit properly
- [ ] Thank you page redirects correctly
- [ ] Email automation triggers on form submit
- [ ] Payment gateway tested (if applicable)
- [ ] SSL certificate active (https, not http)

## Tracking & Analytics

- [ ] Google Analytics installed
- [ ] Meta Pixel installed (for Facebook ads)
- [ ] Conversion events set up
- [ ] UTM parameters added to ad links
- [ ] Goal tracking configured
- [ ] Heatmap tool installed (Hotjar or similar)

## Copy & Messaging

- [ ] Headline addresses main pain point
- [ ] Benefits focused (not features)
- [ ] One clear CTA per section
- [ ] Testimonials include specific results
- [ ] No jargon or confusing language
- [ ] Mobile friendly font sizes (16px minimum)
- [ ] Bullet points for easy scanning

## Design & UX

- [ ] CTA button stands out (contrasting color)
- [ ] White space around important elements
- [ ] Images load fast (compressed, optimized)
- [ ] Video embedded (not external link)
- [ ] Navigation removed (for high intent pages)
- [ ] Exit intent popup configured

## Trust & Credibility

- [ ] Client testimonials with photos
- [ ] Results in numbers (%, $, timeframe)
- [ ] Trust badges (payment security, certifications)
- [ ] Privacy policy linked
- [ ] Terms of service linked
- [ ] Contact information visible

## Forms

- [ ] Only essential fields (less is more)
- [ ] Clear labels above each field
- [ ] Error messages helpful (not generic)
- [ ] Submit button says what happens next
- [ ] Confirmation message after submit
- [ ] Auto responder email sends immediately

## Pre Launch Test

- [ ] Fill out form yourself (test full flow)
- [ ] Check on mobile device
- [ ] Check on different browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox)
- [ ] Send test traffic (small ad budget)
- [ ] Monitor first 50 visitors for issues

## Post Launch Optimization

- [ ] Review analytics weekly
- [ ] Check heatmaps for scroll depth
- [ ] Read form abandonment data
- [ ] A/B test headlines
- [ ] A/B test CTA button text
- [ ] Adjust based on user behavior

**Rule:** Launch fast, optimize later. A live page with 80% optimization beats a perfect page that never launches.

Use this checklist every time. It's saved me from costly mistakes.
