# Landing Page Strategy Framework

My proven approach to building landing pages that convert visitors into customers.

## The 5 Section Framework

**1. Hero Section (Above the Fold)**
- Clear headline that speaks to the main pain point
- Subheadline that explains the solution
- Strong CTA button (action oriented, not "Learn More")
- Visual that shows the outcome, not the process

Example (UK Relocation System):
Headline: "Relocate to the UK Without the Stress"
Subheadline: "Complete visa processing, job placement, and settlement support in one place"
CTA: "Start Your UK Journey"

**2. Social Proof Section**
- Client testimonials with photos
- Results in numbers (%, $, or specific outcomes)
- Trust badges (payment security, certifications)

**3. Benefits Section (Not Features)**
People don't care about what you do. They care about what they GET.

Bad: "We offer comprehensive relocation services"
Good: "Land your dream UK job in 90 days or less"

**4. How It Works (3 Simple Steps)**
Break down the process into bite sized actions. Remove confusion.

Step 1: Book consultation
Step 2: Get your customized plan
Step 3: We handle everything else

**5. Final CTA with Urgency**
Repeat the main CTA with a deadline or bonus incentive.

"Start today and get free visa document review (Worth $200)"

## Conversion Optimization Checklist

- Mobile responsive (60%+ traffic is mobile)
- Load time under 3 seconds
- One clear goal per page (don't confuse visitors)
- Remove navigation menu (fewer exit points)
- Use contrasting CTA button colors
- Add exit intent popup for abandoners
- Set up tracking pixels (Meta, Google Ads)

## Real Results

This framework increased conversion rates from 2% to 6% for a travel consulting client and generated $12K in the first 30 days for an e-commerce store.

Use it. Tweak it. Make money.
